# FlowPay: Global Instant Settlement Network

**One-liner:** The first cross-border payment network that settles instantly using Aptos parallel execution, enabling real-time FOREX trading and automated treasury management for global businesses.

## Problem Statement

Current cross-border payments suffer from:
- **Settlement delays**: 3-5 business days for traditional transfers
- **High fees**: 5-8% for remittances, 2-4% for business payments
- **FOREX inefficiency**: Static rates, no real-time hedging for SMEs
- **Liquidity fragmentation**: Capital locked across multiple corridors
- **Compliance overhead**: Manual KYC/AML processes

**Market size**: $150T+ annual cross-border payments, $700B+ remittances

## Solution: Why Aptos Enables This Better

FlowPay leverages Aptos' unique primitives:

1. **Parallel Execution**: Process thousands of payments simultaneously
2. **Sub-second finality**: True instant settlement vs. 10+ min on other chains
3. **Native CLOB**: Real-time FOREX with institutional-grade orderbooks
4. **Low fees**: <$0.01 per transaction vs. $50+ traditional wire fees
5. **Move safety**: Formal verification prevents payment routing errors
6. **Account abstraction**: Seamless UX without seed phrases

## Detailed Technical Architecture

### 1. Payment Router Contract
`
``move
module flowpay::payment_router {
    use std::signer;
    use aptos_framework::coin;
    use aptos_framework::timestamp;
    
    struct PaymentRoute has key {
        route_id: u64,
        sender: address,
        recipient: address,
        amount: u64,
        source_currency: TypeInfo,
        target_currency: TypeInfo,
        exchange_rate: u64,
        status: u8, // 0: pending, 1: processing, 2: completed, 3: failed
        created_at: u64,
    }
    
    struct GlobalPaymentRegistry has key {
        routes: Table<u64, PaymentRoute>,
        next_route_id: u64,
        total_volume: u64,
    }
    
    public entry fun initiate_payment<SourceCoin, TargetCoin>(
        sender: &signer,
        recipient: address,
        amount: u64,
        max_slippage: u64
    ) acquires GlobalPaymentRegistry {
        // 1. Validate sender balance
        // 2. Get optimal exchange rate from FOREX engine
        // 3. Create payment route with parallel execution
        // 4. Trigger compliance check
        // 5. Execute atomic swap if same-chain, bridge if cross-chain
    }
    
    public fun execute_parallel_settlement(
        routes: vector<u64>
    ) acquires GlobalPaymentRegistry {
        // Leverage Aptos parallel execution for batch processing
        // Process up to 1000 payments simultaneously
    }
}
```

### 2. FOREX Engine Integration

```move
module flowpay::forex_engine {
    use merkle_trade::clob;
    use hyperion::price_feed;
    
    struct CurrencyPair has key {
        base: TypeInfo,
        quote: TypeInfo,
        current_rate: u64,
        last_updated: u64,
        daily_volume: u64,
    }
    
    public fun get_real_time_rate<Base, Quote>(): u64 {
        // 1. Query Merkle Trade CLOB for live rates
        // 2. Aggregate with Hyperion price feeds
        // 3. Apply liquidity-based adjustments
        // 4. Return optimal execution rate
    }
    
    public fun execute_forex_swap<From, To>(
        amount: u64,
        min_output: u64
    ): u64 {
        // Atomic currency conversion using native CLOB
        // Guaranteed execution within single block
    }
}
```

### 3. Treasury Vault System

```move
module flowpay::treasury_vault {
    struct CorporateVault has key {
        owner: address,
        balances: Table<TypeInfo, u64>,
        auto_hedge_enabled: bool,
        risk_parameters: RiskConfig,
        payment_schedules: vector<ScheduledPayment>,
    }
    
    struct ScheduledPayment has store {
        recipient: address,
        amount: u64,
        currency: TypeInfo,
        frequency: u64, // seconds
        next_execution: u64,
    }
    
    public entry fun setup_payroll_automation(
        company: &signer,
        employees: vector<address>,
        salaries: vector<u64>,
        currency: TypeInfo
    ) {
        // Automated payroll with multi-currency support
        // Leverages Aptos' scheduled transactions
    }
    
    public fun auto_hedge_exposure(
        vault: &mut CorporateVault
    ) {
        // Automatically hedge FOREX exposure using derivatives
        // Integrates with prediction markets for risk management
    }
}
```
